simple proxy that i use to make web dev less annoying: throw a proxy in front, and when the server restarts, instead of a connection failure you get a hang. let the proxy retry for you.

pretty much for myself. if you want to use, you'll need to install the binary, set up a config file, edit and install the plist. ask chatgpt if you need help doing that stuff.

prs are likely to be ignored unless they are tiny and compelling. this is for me, and it is done for the forseeable future. if you want to change it for you, fork it and go nuts.
